# EthereumPrice-Prediction-DataPipeline (Work in Progress)

I recently won some ETH in an online giveaway. I would like to hold some of that ETH long term in anticipation that the value will skyrocket.
With that in mind for this project I plan to use Apache Spark, Databricks Notebook and AWS practice price prediction.
I will just be using the date and price values for ETH from the day of inception to today (date of date)
